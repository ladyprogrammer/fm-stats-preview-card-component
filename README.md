## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS (Flexbox, Grid, custom properties)
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge helped me explore and learn the current practices in HTML and CSS. I made some twist on the challenge by doing desktop-first workflow, before the mobile one.

- More centering practices for mastery - you need to really understand and save snippets of codes if Flex and Grid are not sufficient.


### Continued development

I am into developing web applications professionally using Angular at the moment, but I felt the need to do the challenges to keep my base skill knowledge sharp. I might do most of the easier challenges first to focus on HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript and probably Typescript.

### Useful resources
